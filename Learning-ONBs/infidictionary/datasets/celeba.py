class CelebADataset(IrregularDataset):
    """
    Pre-loads `n_images` images from the CelebA-HQ dataset and exposes them
    as an IrregularDataset.

    `n_drop_draws` independent pixel-dropping patterns are pre-computed at
    construction time (seeded, reproducible).  Each pattern is drawn via
    independent Bernoulli sampling with keep-probability ``1 - drop_fraction``,
    so pattern lengths vary naturally across draws.

    The effective dataset size is ``n_images * n_drop_draws``: every
    (image, drop-pattern) pair is a distinct sample.

    get_batch selects one drop pattern uniformly at random, then draws
    `batch_size` images — all sharing that same irregular grid for the call.

    __call__(seed) is fully deterministic:
        image index = (seed // n_drop_draws) % n_images
        drop  index =  seed  % n_drop_draws
